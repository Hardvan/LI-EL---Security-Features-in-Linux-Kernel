# Linux Security and Containerization Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts and programs that demonstrate key Linux security mechanisms, network namespaces, and containerization concepts.

## 1. Exploring Linux Namespaces

### 1_create_and_explore_namespace.sh

This Bash script demonstrates how to create and explore a Linux network namespace.

- **Creating a namespace:** `sudo ip netns add mynamespace` creates an isolated network namespace called `mynamespace`.
- **Listing namespaces:** `ip netns list` displays all existing network namespaces.
- **Setting up loopback:** `sudo ip netns exec mynamespace ip link set lo up` enables the loopback interface inside the namespace.
- **Launching a shell:** `sudo ip netns exec mynamespace bash` opens an interactive shell within `mynamespace`, allowing users to run commands (`ip a`, `ping 127.0.0.1`) in an isolated network.

This script helps in understanding how Linux network namespaces work, isolating network environments for testing or security purposes.

### 2_demo_namespace_creation.c

This C program uses the `clone()` system call to create a new network namespace and run a child process within it.

- **Namespace creation:** `clone(child_main, child_stack + STACK_SIZE, CLONE_NEWNET | SIGCHLD, NULL)` creates a child process with a separate network namespace.
- **Child process function (`child_main`)** launches a bash shell inside the new namespace, where users can run networking commands (`ip link`, `ip addr`).
- **Parent process waits:** `waitpid(pid, NULL, 0)` ensures that the main process waits for the child process to complete.

By running `sudo ./demo_namespace_creation`, users can interact with an isolated network environment, reinforcing namespace concepts.

## 2. Demo Security Features

### 1_automate_patch_application.sh

**Purpose:** Automatically checks for and applies system updates, ensuring that security patches and other critical updates are installed.

#### Steps:

1. Runs `sudo apt update` to refresh the list of available package updates.
2. Runs `sudo apt upgrade -y` to install available updates, including kernel patches.
3. Confirms successful update application.

### 2_policy_management_example.sh

**Purpose:** Applies a security policy using SELinux to define and enforce access rules for web content.

#### Steps:

1. Uses `sudo semanage fcontext` to set the SELinux context of `/var/www/html` as `httpd_sys_content_t` (web content).
2. Runs `sudo restorecon -Rv /var/www/html` to apply and enforce the SELinux policy.
3. Confirms that the policy has been applied.

**Error Handling:** If the SELinux rule is already defined, the script might show a `ValueError`, indicating that the policy is redundant.

These scripts are useful for automating security best practices on Linux systems, reducing manual effort while ensuring consistency in system updates and policy enforcement.

## 3. Evaluating Security Mechanisms

### 1_simulate_privilege_escalation_attempt.sh

**Purpose:** Tests whether unauthorized access to sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) is blocked.

#### Steps:

1. Attempts to read `/etc/shadow`, which contains hashed passwords.
   - **Expected behavior:** The operation should be denied due to file permissions and SELinux policies.
2. Confirms that the security mechanisms are working as intended.

**Outcome:**

- If permissions are correctly set, the attempt is blocked (`Permission denied`).
- This validates that security policies prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

### 2_stress_test_for_namespaces.sh

**Purpose:** Tests the systemâ€™s ability to handle multiple network namespaces.

#### Steps:

1. Creates 10 network namespaces (`testns1` to `testns10`).
2. Lists all active namespaces to verify their creation.
3. Deletes the namespaces to clean up.

**Outcome:**

- This simulates a stress test by rapidly creating and removing namespaces.
- If the system handles it well, it confirms that namespace isolation is functioning properly.

These scripts help assess security enforcement (privilege escalation protection) and system resilience (namespace management).

## 4. Containerization Demo

### 1_mini_container.c

**Purpose:** Creates a simple container using Linux namespaces.

#### Key Features:

- Uses `clone()` to create a new process with UTS, PID, and mount namespaces.
- Sets a custom hostname (`mini-container`).
- Mounts the `/proc` filesystem to support process-related commands.
- Launches an interactive bash shell inside the container.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Inside the container, commands like `hostname`, `ps aux`, and `ls /proc` work independently of the host.
- Running `exit` terminates the container.

**Takeaway:** This is a lightweight, low-level way to create containers without Docker.

### 2_docker_container_demo.sh

**Purpose:** Automates the process of building, running, interacting with, and cleaning up a Docker container.

#### Key Features:

- Checks Docker installation.
- Creates a `Dockerfile` using Alpine Linux as the base image.
- Builds a Docker image and runs a detached container.
- Executes a command inside the container to print the hostname and a custom environment variable (`DEMO_MSG`).
- Cleans up the container, image, and temporary files.

**Expected Behavior:**

- The script prints messages with emoji-enhanced explanations for clarity.
- The Docker container echoes its hostname and a predefined message before sleeping indefinitely.
- Cleanup removes all traces of the container after execution.

**Takeaway:** This showcases a high-level approach to containerization, making it easier to package and deploy applications.
